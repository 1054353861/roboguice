This branch is the official feature branch to plugin the new annotation system inside RG 3.0.

Please beware of artifact version number. When this branch is merged, all versions must be reverted to a normal numbering scheme (without blender).
Tis applies to RoboGuice. But what to do with nested Guice tree ? How can we get the artifacts we need, globally ?
